# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Flight fare prediction models aim to estimate the cost of airline tickets using machine learning techniques. Key models include Decision Tree and Random Forest. 

This process involves analyzing various factors that influence ticket prices and utilizing sophisticated algorithms to predict future fares. Two widely used machine learning techniques for this purpose are Decision Tree and Random Forest models. Here, we explore how these models work, their advantages, and their roles in flight fare prediction.

Decision Tree Model
A Decision Tree is a simple yet powerful algorithm that splits data into branches based on feature values. It mimics human decision-making by dividing the data into subsets, with each node representing a feature and each branch representing a decision rule. The tree structure allows the model to make predictions by following the branches from the root to the leaves, where each leaf node represents a final prediction (in this case, the flight fare).

How It Works
Feature Selection: The algorithm selects the most significant feature (e.g., airline, departure time, day of the week) that best splits the data.
Splitting: It divides the dataset into subsets based on the chosen feature, creating branches.
Recursive Splitting: The process is repeated recursively for each subset, considering other features until the stopping criteria are met (e.g., maximum depth of the tree, minimum number of samples per leaf).
Prediction: Once the tree is built, it can predict flight fares by traversing the tree based on the input features.
Advantages
Interpretability: Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making it clear how predictions are made.
Non-linearity: They can model non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
Disadvantages
Overfitting: Decision Trees are prone to overfitting, especially with complex datasets. They can create overly complex trees that do not generalize well to new data.
Instability: Small changes in the data can lead to significantly different tree structures.
Random Forest Model
The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness. It addresses the limitations of individual Decision Trees by reducing overfitting and increasing stability.

How It Works
Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging): The algorithm generates multiple subsets of the original dataset by sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a separate Decision Tree.
Random Feature Selection: At each split in the trees, a random subset of features is considered, introducing additional randomness and reducing correlation among the trees.
Aggregation: The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all individual trees (for regression tasks like flight fare prediction) or by majority voting (for classification tasks).
Advantages
Accuracy: Random Forests generally provide higher accuracy than individual Decision Trees by combining the strengths of multiple trees.
Overfitting Reduction: By averaging the results of many trees, Random Forests reduce the risk of overfitting, especially with noisy data.
Robustness: They are less sensitive to data variability and outliers, offering more stable predictions.
Disadvantages
Complexity: Random Forests are more complex and computationally intensive than single Decision Trees.
Interpretability: They are less interpretable due to the ensemble nature, making it harder to understand the contribution of each feature to the final prediction.
Application in Flight Fare Prediction
In flight fare prediction, both Decision Tree and Random Forest models analyze historical flight data, including features such as:

Date and Time: Departure and arrival times, day of the week, and seasonality.
Airline: Different airlines may have different pricing strategies.
Route: Distance between origin and destination, direct or connecting flights.
Booking Time: How far in advance the ticket is booked.
Class: Economy, business, or first class.
By training on historical fare data, these models can predict future ticket prices, helping travelers find the best deals and airlines optimize their pricing strategies.

Conclusion
Decision Tree and Random Forest models are powerful tools for predicting flight fares. While Decision Trees offer simplicity and interpretability, Random Forests provide enhanced accuracy and robustness. Together, these models contribute significantly to understanding and forecasting airline ticket prices, benefiting both consumers and the aviation industry.
